Red Rover

by Erik Osheim

    You are a scientific rover robot. You have been sent (alone) to a distant
    planet to analyze rocks. Earn points by analyzing rocks.
    
    There is no plan to rescue you upon completion of your mission.


Requires Python and Pygame. Play the game by running ./play or using python to
run src/game.py.

Use arrow keys to move the rover, space to pick up (and drop) rocks to analyze.
Held rocks may also be pulverized using the control key.
